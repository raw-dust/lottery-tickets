# lottery-tickets
This will generate random lottery tickets for any draw game 
It will choose numbers from two different groups of numbers
For games like Powerball and Mega Millions the first group would be the white balls and the second group would be the Powerball/Meagball
For games like Lottery, which only have one group of numbers, set the balls drawn to zero
